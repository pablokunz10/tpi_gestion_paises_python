## Description

Console-based application built in Python for managing country data (name, population, area, and continent). The system applies core programming concepts including lists, dictionaries, functions, conditionals, sorting algorithms, and basic statistics.

Data is stored in a CSV file (`paises.csv`), which is loaded at startup and updated when changes are saved.

## Features

1. Display all countries
2. Add a new country (empty fields not allowed)
3. Update population and area of a country
4. Search country by name (partial or exact match)
5. Filter by continent (case-insensitive, accent-insensitive)
6. Filter by population range
7. Filter by area range
8. Sort countries by name, population, or area (ascending/descending)
9. Show statistics (highest/lowest population, averages, countries per continent)
10. Save changes to CSV file
11. Exit (auto-saves before closing)
